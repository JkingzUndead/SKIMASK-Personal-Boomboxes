To make it work, follow these steps (I'm assuming you are using thunderstore mod manager):
Step 1: Download BepinEx, YourOwnPersonalBoombox and SKIMASKPersonalBoomboxes mods
Step 2: Start up Lethal Company modded
Step 3: Quit Lethal Company
Step 4: Find your BepinEx/Plugins files with your mods
Step 5: Open the SKIMASK-SKIMASKPersonalBoomboxes folder and the Your Own Personal Boomboxes folder
Step 6: Move the 3 folders Juvi, Lazy, and Robbie from the SKIMASK-PersonalBoomboxes folder to the Your Own Personal Boomboxes folder
Step 7: Enjoy

Any modifications made to the folder, all clients MUST have the same folder modifications.
